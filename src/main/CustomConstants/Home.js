    title: "What is the difference between Freemium and Premium Memberships?",
    description:
      "Freemium Members have only limited access to the Tripello Travel Platform. As a Freemium Member you can only book from over 1.5 million Hotels and you can only get savings up to 25%. The massive savings are reserved for our members.",
  },
  {
    title:
      "What is the difference between a Premium and Premium Plus Membership?",
    description:
      "Both memberships get full access to the Tripello Travel Platform. Premium Plus Members get a better monthly price for their longer commitment. In addition, Premium Plus Members get access to the Tripello Rewards program.",
  },
  {
    title: "Can I upgrade from Premium to Premium Plus Membership?",
    description:
      "This cannot be done during your active Membership. Once your Premium Membership comes to an end, you can set it to cancel and you will be downgraded to a Freemium Member, then you can upgrade again to a Premium Plus Membership.",
  },
  {
    title: "Do I have to go through Hoops and Loops to become a Member?",
    description:
      "NO, we don’t ask you to watch a pointless 30 minute presentation just to find out you still need to sign up for a demo or ask for your email first before seeing what we have to offer. At Tripello we strive for true transparency. What you see is what you get. Just sign up with your Name and email for a Freemium Membership and you can explore our platform in your own time. Take as long as you like",
  },
  {
    title: "Do you always have the cheapest Hotels?",
    description:
      "Just like anyone else in the industry we cannot claim we always have the cheapest hotel, or the hotel that you are looking for at the cheapest price. We might, we might not. And if we don’t we may have a similar hotel with equal or greater quality (Rating) for a lower price. We can only show you what is truly available at highly discounted rates at the moment of your search and based on your search parameters.",
  },
  {
    title: "Is Tripello not just the same as KAYAK or TRIVAGO?",
    description:
      "NO, not at all. There is a big difference. Sites like KAYAK and TRIVAGO are called MetaSearch Engines. All that they do is crawl the internet for Travel websites and their pricing and then compile the information to show you the lowest price available. But these are PUBLIC Prices and NOT the prices Tripello has access to. Our Prices are NOT publically available and therefore can only be presented in a Closed User Group (CUG).",
  },
  {
    title: "Do you have all the same Hotels as the other sites?",
    description:
      "This again varies depending on your search and the dates you choose. Every time you click the search button we initiate a LIVE search, scanning tens of thousands of wholesale contracts throughout the world. We don’t work off a database with paid contracts like the Big Guys do. We show you what is truly available at the lowest price at the time of your search. Most of the time we have the same hotels and other times we have incredible hotel deals that the Big Buys cannot offer or don’t have access to.",
  },
  {
    title: "How are you able to beat the Big Guys?",
    description:
      "The Travel Industry is very complicated and can be very confusing. Due to our access to Wholesale Pricing, the fact that we chose a subscription based business model and streamlined our process through advanced technology our costs are way lower. So we are able to strip everything. We do not need Commissions, Booking Fees, Mark Ups or fees of any kind to pay for a massive overhead. We pass the savings on to YOU.",
  },
  {
    title: "Do you have a Rewards Program?",
    description:
      "Yes, we do. Our Premium Plus Members have access to our Tripello Rewards Program. They have their own Freemium Member Invitation link or QR Code that they can share with whomever they think enjoys travel. Once a Freemium Member they have invited upgrades to a Premium or Premium Plus Membership they will get their rewards credited to their wallet, and they can use these rewards towards any booking on our site. The rewards are $25 for each Premium and $50 for each Premium Plus Member.",
  },
  {
    title: "Do you have Taxes and Fees included in your prices?",
    description:
      "Yes, what you see is what you pay. No unexpected surprises at checkout like some other sites do. All prices include all fees and taxes (except resort fees).",
  },
  {
    title: "What about Resort Fees?",
    description:
      "Well, Resort Fees can be a bummer and unfortunately there is nothing we can do about them as they are outside of our control and have to be paid on site. But we have a price breakdown for each search result and it will show you if there will be resorts fees applied when you check in and how much they are.",
  },
  {
    title: "Can I book for friends and family?",
    description:
      "Yes, you can AS LONG AS you yourself will be on the itinerary and the trip you are booking. You can book for up to 6 people at a time.",
  },

  {
    title: "Will I get my MILES for flights booked on Tripello?",
    description:
      "Yes, when booking a flight you will have the option to enter your Frequent Flyer Number and then you will be able to collect your miles from the airline and add them to your account.",
  },
  {
    title: "Can I redeem my MILES?",
    description:
      "No, unfortunately not. Not at this time. But you will be able to accumulate and collect miles on flights you book through Tripello.",

    title: "Can I use any Third Party Loyalty Rewards or Points on Tripello?",
    description:

    title: "Can I see the prices in my local currency?",
    description:
      "Yes, we offer the option to see prices in a large variety of local currencies. At the time of your booking you will be billed in US $ and it will be converted into your local currency.",
  },
  {
    title: "How do I cancel my subscription?",
    description:
      "We surely would hate to see you leave but we don’t want to make that process a pain either. In your Profile Section you will find a switch that you set and then confirm. Your Membership will be downgraded to a Freemium Membership and you can always come back later if you change your mind and upgrade again. You will receive an additional confirmation email with your Membership status change. Due to our business model that requires a Closed User Group (Members Only) – we cannot refund any of the price for the remaining time of your 6 or 12-month subscription at the time of your cancellation. You have 1 week before renewal to cancel your subscription.",
